## 📦 Features

- 🎨 Gradient color segments applied to each row in the table
- 🌊 Two types of text animation effects: `wave` and `waveFlow`
- 🔄 Automatic data refresh every 1.2 seconds
- 🧩 Fully configurable via Flask backend (`/data` endpoint)
- 💡 Simple and clean front-end implementation using vanilla JavaScript
